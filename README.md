# WILS_RH_DB
WILS project on RH database

## AIMS

1. Describe the RH database: 

* how many "clusters" are there? (a cluster = "community\_1\_subcommunity_0")
* how many plasmids are in each cluster? 
* how many clusters have only 1 plasmid? 


2. Find all plasmids in the RH database (built from PLSDB) that have IMP-4

* How many plasmids have IMP-4?
	* What locations have these plasmids come from? (make a chart)
	* What are these plasmid Inc types? (make a chart)
	* what species have these plasmids come from? (make a chart) 
* Which clusters do these plasmids belong to? 
	* What is the proportion of IMP-4 plasmids within the cluster? (eg. 4 plasmids out 40 in this cluster have IMP-4)

3. Focus on one or two small clusters with IMP-4 plasmids: 

* what is the location of Inc type of all plasmids in this cluster? 
* Download all Genbank files from NCBI:
	* what are the lengths of these plasmids? 
	* What AMR genes do these plasmids have? (Abricate)
	* What virulence genes do these plasmids have? (Abricate)
	* What is the sequence similarity between samples? (Clinker)
	* are the IMP-4 genes in the same location in all plasmids?
